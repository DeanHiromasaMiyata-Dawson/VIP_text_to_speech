speak_biomarker_labels.py

Polls the live biomarker endpoint served by `avro_stream_poller_with_ml.py`
(from the VIP_psychological_dashboard project) and reads new Frustration /
Mental Demand label updates aloud using offline text-to-speech (pyttsx3).

WHY pyttsx3:
- Runs fully offline, no API key or network call needed per utterance
- Works on Windows (SAPI5), macOS (NSSpeechSynthesizer), and Linux (espeak)
- Well suited to a continuously-running local monitoring loop like this one,
  where you don't want cloud latency, cost, or a dependency on internet
  access just to announce a label change

SETUP
-----
1. Make sure the live poller from the project is already running in another
   terminal, as described in the project's README:

       python avro_stream_poller_with_ml.py

   This exposes live predictions at http://127.0.0.1:7000/latest

2. Install dependencies for this script:

       pip install pyttsx3 requests

   On Linux, pyttsx3 also needs espeak installed at the OS level, e.g.:

       sudo apt-get install espeak

3. Run this script in a separate terminal:

       python speak_biomarker_labels.py

USAGE NOTES
-----------
- This script only SPEAKS. It does not modify the dashboard or the poller.
- The /latest JSON structure is confirmed from the actual project source
  (avro_stream_poller_with_ml.py + biomarker_runtime.py) -- see
  extract_labels() below for the exact fields used.
- The script only announces a label out loud when it CHANGES (or the first
  time it's seen), so it doesn't repeat "Frustration: High" every 5 seconds
  if nothing has changed.
- Frustration needs 2 minute-level samples and Mental Demand needs 1 before
  either model is "ready". Until then this script announces "Pending" once,
  then announces the real label once it resolves.

VOICE COACH MODE (added for the construction worker stress-feedback assignment)
-------------------------------------------------------------------------------
Everything above still works exactly as before. Adding --coach switches from
announcing labels to giving the worker short, escalating spoken messages:

    High stress            -> "Are you feeling tired? Please have some water."
    20 min of stress       -> "Please take a break; you've been stressed for 20 minutes."
    45 min of stress       -> required break (repeats every 10 min while it continues)
    Heat strain            -> warm skin + fast pulse: shade and water
    Racing heart           -> pulse above limit for 2 min: slow down, watch footing
    Focus-heavy work       -> high mental demand only: double-check critical steps
    Recovery               -> 5 calm minutes after an episode: positive feedback
    Hydration              -> every 60 min on shift

Design rules: one message at a time (highest priority wins), per-alert
cooldowns, low-confidence predictions ignored (frustration macro-F1 ~0.61,
mental demand ~0.52), calm voice for check-ins and firm voice for safety
alerts (macOS `say`, else the pyttsx3 engine above), English or Spanish.
Every coach alert is logged to voice_alert_log.csv next to this file.

       python speak_biomarker_labels.py --coach                          # live data
       python speak_biomarker_labels.py --simulate                       # 70-min shift demo, no wristband
       python speak_biomarker_labels.py --simulate --worker-name Carlos
       python speak_biomarker_labels.py --simulate --lang es
       python speak_biomarker_labels.py --simulate --dry-run             # print only, no audio

Messages live in COACH_MESSAGES and thresholds in COACH_CONFIG.

SECURITY NOTE
-------------
avro_stream_poller_with_ml.py (as provided) contains hardcoded AWS
credentials. Those should be rotated immediately and moved to environment
variables -- they should never live in source code, especially in a public
repo. This script does not need or use any AWS credentials; it only talks
to your local http://127.0.0.1:7000/latest endpoint.
